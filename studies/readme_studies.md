Studies readme file
===================

### Intro
There are three main parts on the TLPM  Machine project:
1. **data_transform**. The goal is transform all given data on **tidy data**
2. **prediction**. The goal is get a prediction by different types of regression.
3. **options**. The goal is to obtain different options (regarding adaptative methods to produuce predictions)

## Tidy data
As any *data scientist* know, **raw data** comes in diferent formats and should be transformed on handly stardard **tidy data** to can used it in a general context.

The goal is to obtain data as follow:
- columns: (1) predicted + next columns (predictors)
- rows: different cases by rows

We are going to start working with standard library to *data manipulation*. If any extra source is required, we need to justify about that.

## prediction
In this part, we aim to can select the "forecasting mode" (it could be as simple as a "linear regression" or advanced methods like "Artificial Neural Networks")

## options
All kind of option will be given on the TLPM software. Some suggestion:
- mixture of predictions
- bias corrections
- adaptative extra methods
- dummies guides
- etc.

### Suggestions
All sugestions will be wellcome.
Please, give us our suggestions and, if you want to contribute, do not doubt to contact us [@borjavss](https://twitter.com/borjavss).
If you have already hard worked, send us a "pull request" ;)
