{"name":"TLPM","tagline":"The Last PredIctIons Machine","body":"### Welcome to \"The LAST Predictions Machine\"\r\nThis is a funny project which aims to get the most *flexible* **prediction software** in the world. The purpose is to get a **R software library** to quickly solve hard prediction problems with amazing accuracy.\r\n\r\n### Aimed Solutions\r\nGet a less 5 min forecasting with incredible accuracy from any given subject data incoming. We want to start giving solutions to subjects related with environmental concerns (like producing weather forecasting to *renewable energy* producers) and, we will follow by giving solutions to social problems by future predictions.\r\n\r\n### TLPM Machine Processes\r\nThe following phases will be deployed inside our \"TLPM Machine\" to get our prediction:\r\n- An **easy tool package** helps to quickly get our **\"tidy data\"** from any given **\"raw data\"**.\r\n- Select your **\"forecasting mode\"** (it could be as simple as a *\"linear regression\"* or heavy predictions methods like *\"Artificial Neural Networks\"*).\r\n- **\"Extra options\"** like a \"mixture of all methods\" (by using *boosting* supervised learning method) or adding other adaptative methods to predictions.\r\n\r\n### Repository\r\nWe have created this work *repository* to upload our advances and publish all the information about the project. In the other hand, an incoming flux of information will be welcome if anyone in the world want to give us code suggestions or advertising about remarkable problems to repair on the \"last prediction machine\".\r\n\r\n### Feel free to \"fork\" it and \"play\" with us!\r\n![alt brain_power](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5538/9563085778_3a99d700e0_z.jpg \"Imagination\")\r\n\r\n#### Author and Contributors\r\nBorjaVSS is the *alma matter* of the project.
