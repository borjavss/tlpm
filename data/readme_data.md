This is the "readme" of data folder
===================================
This folder will be divided on sub-folders with different tipes of data.
We prefer to leave data on their current hosting place in order to not subcharge github directories.

#### Sub-data folders
At the same time, each sub-folder will have another "readme" document with this data specifications:

- Data info
- Where is the data available (link to general info).
- How to get the data (direct link to data documents).
- Some specifications about how to use it and what is its structure.
- Data notes

As well as other specifications if necessary or desired.

#### Working data directory
To maintain a data working directory, each time that a new sub-data folder be added, should be writen here:
- (nothing)
- (nothing)
- (nothing)
