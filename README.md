The Last Predictions Machine - TLPM
====

You can find project presentation on http://borjavss.github.io/tlpm/

The first part of this project (June 15th) is based on solve an specific problem given on renewable energies based on predictions. A pdf complete rapport is pulled to this repo (rapport_edpr.pdf)

An example of NN used on predictions can be found on the next video 

### Repo "tree diagram":
- data : (each folder contains the documentation of different data to use our *predictions machine*)
- studies : data_transf / prediction / options
- user_manual : (cointains the document -latex- to our prediction software *user manual*)
- scripts : main / functions

### The main idea:

The aims of this practical software is providing comprehensive forecasting methods with the enough sensibly information needed to put it correctly on practice by the easiest way. Everybody can consider search the theoretical details behind each method using the references at the end of each chapter.

This software is coded to a general audience looking for quickly forecasting application methods properly. They could be (1) people without any formal certification in this area (i.e. by looking for improve its business forecasting), (2) undergraduate students approaching forecasting area (i.e. during their studies on practically all different areas -like commerce, human resources or environmental areas) and (3) graduated people working on related areas (i.e. business energy manager needing a quick practical approach to forecasting). 

The used software language used through this softwre is R language and its corresponding R-CRAN open source libraries. Recently, R statistical language was having an incredible usage increment in a lot of industries and by solving different types of problems [1](http://blog.datacamp.com/statistical-language-wars-the-infograph/), even in top level science and research iternational environment. The reason of its success is that it is an “open source” data analysis extremely powerful software operating with a complete accessibility philosophy ressources around it.
